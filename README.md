# Will-a-Customer-Accept-the-Coupon
The major goal of this project is to predict if the drivers with/without passenger will accept more coupons than rejecting them, by using python libraries for visualization, and also conditioning probabilities.


<p style="style="font-weight: bold">1. Certainly the drivers with 'Friend(s)' as passenger are more likely to accept the coupons than not, in particular the coupons: "Coffe House", "Restaurant (<20)", and "Carry out & Take Away" than the rest of the drivers without/with passenger, i.e, 'Alone', "Partner", and "Kid(s)". This is quite evident by looking at the results of the conditional probabilities visualized using histograms shown below</p>
